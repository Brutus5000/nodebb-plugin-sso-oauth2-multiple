# NodeBB OAuth2 Multiple Client SSO

This NodeBB plugin allows you to configure logins to multiple configurable OAuth2 endpoints, via the admin backend.

## Caveat

Different OAuth2 providers adhere to the standard differently.
This plugin is tested primarily against the following providers:

* [Auth0 by Okta](//auth0.com)
* [Okta](//www.okta.com/)

Support for other OAuth2 providers is _explicitly not guaranteed_.
If you'd like to help this plugin play nice with other providers, please
